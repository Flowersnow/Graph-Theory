If you wish to master your problem solving skill, you need to know a couple of graph theory algorithms. Top sites like google, facebook or others, where searching is needed, they need to conduct with graph theory. Here, I just wrote code of different popular graph theory algorithms. If you want to know theoretical details or pseudo-code you may love to visit [Shafayet Vai's Blog](http://www.shafaetsplanet.com/planetcoding/)  .You should/must read CLRS book Introduction to Algorithm to know details.\r\n\r\n# List of Graph Algorithms\r\n\r\n* Articulation Point\r\n* BFS (2D)\r\n* BFS using color\r\n* BFS\r\n* Bellman Ford Algorithm\r\n* Bellman Ford easy\r\n* Cut Vertex\r\n* DFS using matrix\r\n* DFS\r\n* Dijkstra 2D\r\n* Dijkstra easy\r\n* Dijkstra's Algorithm \r\n* Eulerian for Directed Graph\r\n* Eulerian for Undirected Graph\r\n* Floyd Warshall algorithm\r\n* IsBipartite\r\n* MST (2nd Best) Krushkal Algo\r\n* Max Bipartite Matching\r\n* Max Flow Edmonds-Karp Algorithm\r\n* Min Vertex Cover\r\n* Mst Krushkal Algorithm\r\n* Mst Prims Algorithm\r\n* Stable Marriage Probelm\r\n* Strongly Connected Components (query)\r\n* Strongly Connected Components\r\n* Topsort easy full-code\r\n* Topsort easy\r\n* Topsort in DAG\r\n* Union-Find (Disjoint sets data structure)\r\n\r\n# Short Message\r\n* In Algorithms Book Like _Introduction to Algorithm_ by CLRS they just explained about the algorithm, how it works, it's pseudo code, space complexity or time complexity. They didn't code any algorithm cause it's your task to code following pseudo code when you know how an algorithm works. But sometimes it gets harder for a self-learner to code without getting help from others. So, if you are a self-learner these staffs may help you. \r\n* I have tested this codes several times. I think these codes are bug-free! If you find anything wrong feel free to let me know. \r\n\r\n# Warning \r\nDon't copy paste. Open your compiler, code it and feel how it works.\r\n\r\n# With thanks\r\n**Rabiul Awal**\r\nawalrabiul6@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
